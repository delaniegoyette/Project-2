Project 2: House Price Averages

This project is a reflection of the average house prices in different types of living locations: Suburban, Rural, Downtown, and Urban. The code is a function 
that produces the average price of the house in each area when called for and compares them to each other. The visual is a box plot that displays the difference in 
price averages. 

The results are organized in a folder which contains a photo of the plot, the rmd file, the raw data/ dataset. 

Inside the project 2 rmd is a function, which when ran, produces the averages, and the call, which produces the comparison between locations.
